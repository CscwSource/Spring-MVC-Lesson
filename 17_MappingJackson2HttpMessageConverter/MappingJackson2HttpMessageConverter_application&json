20.9.2.5 MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter

An HttpMessageConverter implementation that can read and write JSON using Jackson's ObjectMapper. 
JSON mapping can be customized as needed through the use of Jackson's provided annotations.
 When further control is needed, a custom ObjectMapper can be injected through the ObjectMapper property for cases
  where custom JSON serializers/deserializers need to be provided for specific types.
 By default this converter supports (application/json).
